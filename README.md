# Tweeter (A Twitter/X Clone)

## Author
Connor Warner

## Description

This Django Web Application is a social website called Tweeter that will allow 
users to be able to make posts called Twits that other users can view.
Users of the site will be able to make Twits that contain both text and
pictures via a URL to a picture. Users can also like and unlike Twits that
other users make. In short, there will be a lot of similarity with what we did
with in-class-4.

This project makes use of a custom user model using Djangos AbstractUser model class.

The site makes use of bootstrap to better stylize it.

Tests for the site views check that the view exists at the correct url with the correct content. 
Tests for the models check that the behaviors for the models all behave properly.

The site includes the required files and settings for publishing the site using Heroku.
